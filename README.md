# write*!*

A ready-to-use framework to generate beautiful scientific documents, like journal articles, directly from Markdown text.

**This is still a work in progress!**


## Is this for you?

If you

1. (want to) write your documents in Markdown (or AsciiDoc),
2. and need a beautiful PDF or HTML version of your document,
3. but also a Microsoft Word export,

then this is perfect for you!



# Installation

This installation guide is written for [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), please adapt the commands to your operation system where needed. write*!* should work on all GNU/Linux distributions, as well as OS X and Windows.

Open up your favourite terminal and let’s go!


## Prerequisites

You’ll need to install [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), [pandoc-citeproc](http://pandoc.org/), [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/), [xsltproc](http://xmlsoft.org/), [DocBook XSL stylesheets](http://docbook.sourceforge.net/), [FOP](https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/), and [unoconv](http://dag.wiee.rs/home-made/unoconv/):

```sh
sudo apt-get install make git pandoc pandoc-citeproc asciidoctor xsltproc docbook-xsl fop unoconv
```

Ubuntu is pretty up-to-date on most of the required software. However you can **optionally** update [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/wiki/Installing-the-development-version-of-pandoc) and/or [Asciidoctor](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor#installation) to their respective development versions to get the most out of you document.


## Get write*!*

Get a copy of this repository.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:and3k/write.git
cd write
git submodule update --init
```


## Test your setup

Test if all the tools work.

```sh
make -B demo
```

The output of `make` should look something like this and display no errors:

```

## Update write*!*

If you want to update write*!* to its newest version run:

```sh
cd write
git pull
make upgrade
make -B all
```



# Usage

## Quick start

```sh
cd write
make <Project name>/<Document name>.article
```

This creates a new document named `<Document name>.md` in the folder `Content/<Project name>/`. Add your text (in Markdown), and run `make all` to convert it to PDF, HTML, and Microsoft Word files. Those can then be found in the folder `Output/<Project name>/`. Voilà!


## Example

```sh
cd write
make My_first_paper/Main_text.article
make My_first_paper/SI.article
make all
```


## Under the hood

[Pandoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandoc) converts your [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) document to [AsciiDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc). Asciidoctor further converts it to [DocBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook), which gets converted to a [FO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSL_Formatting_Objects) and then a PDF file by xsltproc and [FOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formatting_Objects_Processor), respectively. In between write*!* adds a bit of magic here and there to make everything play together nicely. In parallel HTML files are generated by either Asciidoctor or xsltproc, and the later’s version is converted to a Word file with unoconv. unoconv is a document converter command-line interface for LibreOffice, so it could also be used to generate ODT or any other files supported by LibreOffice.

This setup allows for a hybrid approach the get the most out both Markdown/Pandoc and AsciiDoc(tor), e.g.:

* Pandoc’s all powerful citeproc extension automatically generates fully formatted references, a feature [complete missing in AsciiDoctor](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/1374).
* Only AsciiDoc supports cross references


## References/Bibliography/Citations

In the YAML header of your document, you can set the following:

* `bibliography`: this should point to your [BibTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) file, which you can put in the folder `References/`. Any other Pandoc-supported bibliography file and its location will work, but then documents will not be automatically updated if the bibliography file changes (see [Known_issues.md](https://github.com/and3k/write/blob/master/Known_issues.md)).
  * Example: `bibliography: References/Demo.bib`.
* `csl`: this should point to any of the [citation styles](http://citationstyles.org/) located in the folder `Citation_styles/` or be left empty. [All publicly available CSL files](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles) are included for your convenience.
  * Example: `csl: Citation_styles/science.csl`.

See also http://pandoc.org/README.html#citations.


## Mixing Markdown and AsciiDoc syntax

With write*!* it’s possible to mix in some AsciiDoc into you Markdown documents. Any AsciiDoc syntax which can’t be interpreted by Pandoc as Markdown can be used.

In addition write*!* enables you to do the following:

* Use cross references in native AsciiDoc syntax (`<<reference-id>>`), becaue Pandoc’s `raw_html` extension is disabled.
* Multi-line blocks (e.g., AsciiDoc tables) will not work with their default syntax, because single new-lines are wrapped into one line by Pandoc. Thereby please add a number sign (`#`) at the end of the line to preserve literal break.
* The `include` directive can to be used either absolute or relative paths. However relative paths have to be relative to the AsciiDoc file, which is located in `Output/<Project name>/`, **not** `Content/<Project name>/`.

Please see `Content/Demo/*.md` for examples.
